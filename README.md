Learning process for creation of Django apps with TDD

This project is my first experience with Django under Python3.
I want to make an application, which provide ability to create and store unique To-Do lists for separate users.
And it provide a web interface for list manipulations

Some history

Basic functional - app can create the unique list and can add items too it. If we know ulique URL for list - we can view it.
Used TDD functional testing and unit testing approach
